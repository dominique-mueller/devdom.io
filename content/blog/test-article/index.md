title: My test article, with a potentially very long title that spans multiple lines

An introduction to the article could be presented right here.

## Formatting

First up, let's test some basic styling. Sometimes, **things are very important**, and sometimes _things need to be highlighted_ in an
article. From time to time, there is also a [link](https://github.com/) you can click, and such [a link could be potentially quite long](https://github.com/).
From time to time, I might use inline code such as a fictional `runMe()` function you can call, or an even longer code block like
`public class TestMe{}` (or something similar). If you want, you can use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>c</kbd> to copy text.

## Lists

Possibly, I might list a few thigs to consider:

- This is a list item that is so long, so incredible long and detailed, so that it spans across multiple lines - how insane is that?!
- Now a shorter second item
  - with
  - nested
  - items
- Followed by a third item, cause why not

There is also the option of ordered lists:

1. First up, let's do a very long long item again, so that we can ensure everything wraps and looks properly across multiple lines
2. Then, a shorter second item
   1. with
   2. nested
   3. items
3. Finally, a third item, who would've guessed

Amazing, those list items. Right?

## Tables

Let's take a look at a table:

| Name      | Description    |
| :-------- | :------------- |
| This item | A good one     |
| That item | Also very good |

## Media

I might even want to include a bunch of imagery, so let's test that.

{{<image src="./images/test-image.jpg" title="This is a test image" alt="Test Image">}}

Perhaps an image that's rather small?

{{<image src="./images/test-image-small.jpg" title="This is a small test image" alt="Small Test Image">}}

Looking good, I have to admit.
